# Dynamic System Modeling Portfolio: Structural and Mechanical Vibrations

## About the project
This repository contains a collection of models for simulating vibrations in structural and mechanical systems, developed during my PhD studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Each indexed folder contains the necessary data, code, and documentation for a specific model, providing a comprehensive and self-contained package for understanding and reproducing the results. The models are primarily implemented in Python, with dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. The accuracy of each model has been validated, with detailed results and analysis presented in the accompanying documentation.
